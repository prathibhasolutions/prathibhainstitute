      <p><strong>2. Turbulent Flow:</strong> Turbulent flow is chaotic and irregular. The fluid particles move in random directions, creating swirls and eddies. This type of flow generally occurs at high velocities or in larger pipes.</p>

      <p><strong>3. Transitional Flow:</strong> Transitional flow is a mixture of laminar and turbulent flow. It occurs when the flow is unstable and fluctuates between laminar and turbulent behavior, typically in intermediate flow conditions.</p>

      <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The type of flow (laminar, turbulent, or transitional) largely depends on the flow velocity, the fluid's properties, and the size of the pipe or channel through which the fluid is flowing.</p>

      <h4>Reynolds Number</h4>
  </div>
  <div class="card-body">
      <p><strong>Reynolds Number Formula:</strong> The Reynolds number (\( Re \)) is a dimensionless quantity used to predict the flow regime in fluid dynamics. It is calculated as:</p>
      <p><strong>Formula:</strong> \( Re = \frac{\rho v D}{\mu} \)</p>
      <p>Where:</p>

      <p><strong>Flow Regimes Based on Reynolds Number:</strong></p>
      <ul>
          <li><strong>Laminar Flow:</strong> \( Re < 2000 \) — Smooth and orderly flow.</li>
          <li><strong>Turbulent Flow:</strong> \( Re > 4000 \) — Chaotic flow with eddies and swirls.</li>
          <li><strong>Transitional Flow:</strong> \( 2000 < Re < 4000 \) — Flow fluctuates between laminar and turbulent.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The Reynolds number helps determine the nature of fluid flow, whether it's smooth (laminar), chaotic (turbulent), or a mix of both (transitional). Higher values indicate more chaotic behavior, while lower values indicate orderly flow.</p>

            <li><strong>Atomizers:</strong> In spray bottles, a fluid is forced through a narrow opening, causing the velocity to increase and pressure to drop, which helps in creating a fine mist.</li>

As a fluid moves, an increase in speed leads to a decrease in pressure or potential energy, and vice versa. This principle is applied in various real-world scenarios, such as in airplane wings and water distribution systems.</p>

        <p><strong>Torricelli's Theorem:</strong> Torricelli’s theorem describes the speed of efflux of a fluid under the force of gravity through an opening in a container. The velocity of the fluid as it exits the hole is similar to the velocity a free-falling object would acquire after falling through the height of the liquid column.</p>

    <div class="card-body">
        <p><strong>Viscous Force:</strong> Viscous force is the force exerted by a fluid due to its viscosity. This force arises when fluid layers move relative to each other, and it resists the motion of the fluid. It depends on the viscosity, velocity gradient, surface area, and the distance between layers of the fluid.</p>
  
        <p><strong>Formula for Viscous Force:</strong> The viscous force \( F \) acting on a fluid is given by:</p>
        <p><strong>Formula:</strong> \( F = \eta \cdot A \cdot \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta x} \)</p>

        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The formula expresses the relationship between the applied viscous force and the fluid's resistance to flow, which is determined by the velocity difference between fluid layers and their distance apart. The larger the viscosity or the velocity gradient, the greater the viscous force.</p>
  
        <p><strong>Variation of Viscosity with Temperature:</strong> Viscosity is temperature-dependent. In general, as the temperature of a liquid increases, its viscosity decreases, because the molecules move faster and can slide past each other more easily. For gases, viscosity increases with temperature because the kinetic energy of molecules increases, leading to more frequent collisions that increase resistance to flow.</p>
  
        
  
        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This equation describes how viscosity decreases exponentially with an increase in temperature for liquids. For gases, the relationship is opposite, with viscosity increasing as temperature increases.</p>

        <p><strong>Terminal Velocity:</strong> Terminal velocity is the constant speed that a freely falling object eventually reaches when the resistance of the medium (air, liquid, etc.) prevents further acceleration. It occurs when the downward force of gravity is balanced by the upward drag force of the fluid, resulting in zero net force.</p>
  
        <p><strong>Formula for Terminal Velocity:</strong> The terminal velocity \( v_t \) of a small spherical object falling through a fluid can be calculated using:</p>

        </ul>
  
        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> When a small particle falls under gravity, it accelerates until the drag force equals the gravitational force. At this point, the particle reaches terminal velocity and continues falling at a constant speed. This formula helps calculate the terminal velocity for spherical objects falling in fluids like water or air.</p>

        <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Surface tension is the force that acts on the surface of a liquid, causing it to behave like a stretched elastic membrane. It results from the cohesive forces between molecules in the liquid, which are stronger at the surface due to the lack of neighboring molecules in the air.</p>
  
        <p><strong>Formula:</strong> The surface tension (\( S \)) is defined as the force per unit length acting along the surface of the liquid:</p>

        <p><strong>Cohesive Forces:</strong> Cohesive forces are the attractive forces between molecules of the same substance. These forces hold the molecules together within the material. In liquids, cohesive forces cause the molecules to stick to each other, leading to phenomena such as surface tension.</p>
  
        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> In a liquid, the molecules experience a pull toward each other, which creates a state of equilibrium in the form of a "surface film." For example, water molecules are attracted to each other, which causes water droplets to form spherical shapes.</p>

        <p><strong>Adhesive Forces:</strong> Adhesive forces are the attractive forces between molecules of different substances. These forces cause a liquid to spread over or stick to a solid surface. The strength of adhesive forces depends on the nature of the materials involved.</p>
  
        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> When a liquid is in contact with a solid surface, adhesive forces cause the liquid to adhere to the surface. In some cases, these forces are stronger than the cohesive forces of the liquid, causing the liquid to climb up the surface (e.g., in capillary action). In other cases, the cohesive forces dominate, and the liquid tends to pull itself together (e.g., water beading on a waxed surface).</p>
  
        <p><strong>Examples of Adhesive Forces:</strong></p>
        <ul>

        <h4>Capillarity</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="card-body">
        <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Capillarity (capillary action) is the rise or fall of a liquid in a narrow tube due to surface tension and adhesive forces between the liquid and the tube.</p>
  
        <hr>
  
        <p><strong>Formula for Capillary Rise or Depression:</strong></p>
        <p>
            \[
            h = \frac{2S \cos \theta}{\rho g r}
            \]
        </p>
        <p>Where:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>\( h \) = Height of liquid rise or fall</li>
            <li>\( S \) = Surface tension of the liquid</li>
            <li>\( \theta \) = Angle of contact</li>
            <li>\( \rho \) = Density of the liquid</li>
            <li>\( g \) = Acceleration due to gravity</li>
            <li>\( r \) = Radius of the capillary tube</li>
        </ul>
  
        <hr>
  
        <p><strong>1. Capillary Rise:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Occurs when <b>adhesive forces</b> (liquid & tube) are <b>stronger</b> than cohesive forces (liquid molecules).</li>
            <li>The liquid climbs up the tube.</li>
            <li><b>Examples:</b> Water rising in a glass capillary, ink being absorbed by blotting paper.</li>
        </ul>
  
        <hr>
  
        <p><strong>2. Capillary Depression:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Occurs when <b>cohesive forces</b> (between liquid molecules) are <b>stronger</b> than adhesive forces (liquid & tube).</li>
            <li>The liquid level lowers in the tube.</li>
            <li><b>Examples:</b> Mercury in a glass tube.</li>
        </ul>
  
        <hr>
  
        <p><strong>Applications of Capillarity:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Rise of water in plants through roots.</li>
            <li>Oil rising in a lamp wick.</li>
            <li>Blotting paper absorbing ink.</li>
            <li>Action of a towel in absorbing water.</li>
